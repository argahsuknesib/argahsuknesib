I am doing my PhD in [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/) under Prof. Femke Ongenae and Prof. Pieter Bonte at UGent - imec researching towards the scalability of the Solid Ecosystem especially focussing on the personal data streams being stored into the Solid Pods. Please feel free to send me a mail in case you find interest in what I do, or just want a quick chat on my work.
