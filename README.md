I am currently a student in Computer Science at the University of Lyon. I am working at Laboratoire Hubert Curien on Knowledge Graphs. I am the recipient of the Charpak Master Scholarship from the French Embassy. I worked as a research intern at the Henry Fayol Institute, an institute of the Ecole des Mines de Saint Etienne for my M1 thesis. I have a Bachelor's degree in computer science and engineering from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, India.

I am currently looking out for PhD positions in Knowledge Graphs and Semantic Web, Data Mining. Please reach out to me if you have any leads!
